# IOT-Based-Fire-Alarm-System
IOT Based Fire Alarm system using NodeMCU WIFI Module which sends notifications (Email, Blynk and Telegram Notifications) to the user warning that there might be a fire outbreak and immediate attention is required. For this implementation we have also considered the smoke factor and hence used MQ-2 Smoke sensor to detect the smoke too.
